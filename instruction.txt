raw data
1. for downstream  1 for testing

create the bootstrap  in  a long list
1000 * 100 =     
cross validation dataset
1000 each from 1-10
generating the data probably be difficult
hits them all equally distributed in the cv
two datasets  bootstrapping and cross valiadation

to do with the data
run 100 regression.
10 from cross valiadation
merge the regression outcome into a gragh

use hidden data to test the accuracy and other metrics
think
